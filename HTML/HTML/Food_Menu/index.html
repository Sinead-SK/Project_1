            They provide many important vitamins and minerals.<br>
           <strong> Choose 5 -7 servings a day.</strong><br>
            The foods in this shelf can help control body weight as part of a healthy lifestyle

            Enjoy a variety of coloured fruit and vegetables to benefit from the different minerals
            and vitamins each contains. Oranges, strawberries or kiwifruit are rich in vitamin C which aids iron
            absorption.
            Most fruit and vegetables are fat free.

        <h2>Cheese Milk & Yogurt</h2>
        <p><strong>Milk, yogurt and cheese</strong> <br>Calcium found in dairy foods is important for bone health and especially during the teenage growth spurt.
             Vitamin D helps absorb calcium better. The Irish diet is low in vitamin D – talk to your pharmacist or doctor about taking a supplement.
              Low fat options provide the same amount of calcium and other nutrients with fewer calories and saturated fat. 
            All foods from this shelf are a good source of calcium, protein, vitamin B12, riboflavin and vitamin A.

             way to reach 5 servings a day if aged 9 to 18 years. Some yogurts and yogurt drinks 
             can have added sugar. Check the label.If choosing dairy alternatives such as soya milk and yogurts,

        <h2>Fatty Oils</h2>
        <p><strong>Foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt</strong>
            Most people consume snacks high in fat, sugar and salt and sugar sweetened drinks up to 
            6 times a day (Healthy Ireland Survey 2016). There are no recommended servings for this shelf 
            because they are not needed for good health. These foods have little nutritional value and may 
            cause obesity which can lead to heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Many processed
             foods like cakes, biscuits and confectionery contain high levels of added sugars and can be 
             high in calories. Eating too much salt can lead to raised blood pressure, which triples your 
             chances of developing heart disease and stroke. Many processed foods like takeaways and ready 
             meals are high in fat and can be harmful to heart health.

        <P><strong>Healthy Eating Tips</strong> Limit foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt to sometimes 
            – not every day. Choose smaller amounts or fun-size servings. Limit chips and takeaway food as much 
            as possible – most are very high in fat, salt and calories. 
            Choose healthy snacks such as fruit and vegetables. Drink water instead of sugary drinks.
